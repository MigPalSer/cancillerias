# cancillerias

Cancillerias ("chanceries") is a free-time made game of strategy in the 1895 era.

As the game is actually developing, the versions here are under "alpha" standard. I am making a prototype and when the game logic reach a satisfactory level I will go to the next steps for develop a proper graphic UI.

I am relatively new in programming so I'm actually using this project to experiment with different patterns and architectures. Sorry for the mess and the vulgar console UI.

The game, and code, is now in Spanish/"spanglish".
